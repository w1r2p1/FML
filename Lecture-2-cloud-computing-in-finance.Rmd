## Cloud computing intro
- This course will expose you to the flexibility of cloud computing and combining R and Python.
- The School has a high performance compute virtual machine, set-up in Microsoft Azure.
- Financial institutions have a long history of heavily investing in technology for gaining market share and defending their current position.
- The democratisation of computing processing power by cloud providers, has lead to an explosion in financial machine learning applications.
- Today technology that would have costed millions 20 years ago can be rented for thousand from these cloud providers

>Meriwther spent $20 million on a state-of-the-art computer system and hired a crack team of financial engineers to run the show at LTCM.....

# What is cloud computing ?
- .heat[Cloud computing shares many of the similarities of electricity]

.center.large[In the early days of electrical power, corporations and factories where powered by on-site small-scale power plants. Today, large scale power plants with efficient transmission networks have powered modern industrial society, allowing electricity to be at everyone's disposal ar reasonable prices]

# What is cloud computing ?

.fat[definitions:]

>A model for enabling ubiquitious, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or server provider interaction

`r tufte::quote_footer("National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) of the US Department of Commerce, 2019")`

>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (**"the cloud"**) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. Typically, you only pay for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

## Essential characteristics of cloud computing solutions
.heatinline[The follow distinguish cloud computing from other solutions, such as on-site high performance computing servers]

- .large.fancy[On-demand self-service] 
  - A consumer can provision computing capacity as needed without interaction with service provider.
- .large.fancy[Broad network access]
  - Computing resources are available to the consumer through the network and can  be accessed fro mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
- .large.fancy[Resource pooling]
  - Resources are dynamically assigned to customers' needs.
- .large.fancy[Rapid elasticity]
  - Capacities can be reconfigured automatically to scale rapidly in response to the changing demand.
- .large.fancy[Measured service]
  - The resource utilisation is automatically controlled and optimised by the cloud systems.  The usage is monitored, measured, and reported.

## Why high performance computing and why now?
.salt[Regulatory response to the flash crash of 2010]
> On the 6th May, 2010 at 2.45 p.m.(EST), the US stock market experienced a nearly 10% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only to recover most of ther loss a few minutes later

.saltinline[It took the regulatory agencies (SEC) five months to come up with an investigation report on this crash]

.heatinline[In the congressional hearings after the event, the SEC official give the primary reason for the long delay as the volumne of data to be investigated (~20 terabytes)]

.heatinline[HPC scientific computing systems such as the National Research Scientific Computing center(NERSC). routinely work with hundreds of terrabytes in minutes]

## QMS Remote analytics Platform (Q-RaP)

- We have recently introduced state-of-the-art cloud computing teaching for the masters students in the Management School

- We have built a high-performance virtual machine in the Azure cloud to expose students to the production-level technologies they will experience in industry.

- SPECIFICATION: A Linux (ubuntu 18.04) operating system (the most popular OS) with 64 vCPUs, 256 GiB of RAM and 100gb of vSSD.

- This will allows us to teach 64-128 students concurrently (with toy computational tasks with each student limited to 1vCPU and 5 GiB RAM)

- Another important aspect of parallel computing is whether the parallel computing problem is *scalable*.
- An inherently serial problem cannot be parallelised, e.g. Figure 1
- Scalable problems have either a scalable problem size or scalable parallelism.
- Either the solution time reduces with the increasing of parallelism or the performance of the solution increases with the problem size.
- The elasticity of the computing architecture is the key to the success of the processing of scalable problems

# Example from the finance industry
####.heat[Monte Carlo (MC) Options Pricing]
- Using arbitrage pricing theory, the option price is equal to the expected payoff $V$ discounted by a factor $D$ which can be evaluated via MC method.
The Monte Carlo estimator of option price is given by
$$C_0=D \times \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\omega \in sampleset}V(\omega)$$
where N is the number of sample paths (simulations)

1. The simulation of each price path is independent of other paths, therefore it is easy to parallel process the simulation of different paths on different computing nodes
2. It is a task-parallel in the sense that simulations of each path is a small task.  However it is not data-parallel since there is no data set to be distributed to different computing nodes.
3. The scalable benefit is improved price accuracy as $N$ increases, the error reduction being approximately $1/\sqrt{N}$

.pull-left[
#### Task-parallel backtesting
- Suppose you need to backtest a basket of different investment strategies to identify the optimal strategies
- The process of each investment strategy is independent of each other and can be run simultaneously.
- Distributing the processing of different strategies to different computing nodes is an *embarrassingly parallel* and *task parallel* implementation.
]
.pull-right[
#### Data-parallel backtesting
- Backtesting on one strategy can also be implemented as *data parallel*
- By generating subsamples from test data set(e.g. by bootstrapping), strategy can be processed on different subsamples simultaneously
- The results on different subsamples is then aggregated to generate the performance and risk report of the strategy

# Improving computational performance

- There is a commonly held misconception that both Python and R are relatively slow programming languages and not appropriate to implement computationally demand tasks in finance.
- This criticism stems from the fact that most financial algorithms require loops and loops are slow on interpreted languages such as R and Python.
- Traditionally C or C++, which are compiled programming languages, have been used to speed up loops.

# Loops using `Numpy`
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Explanation]
- The strength of `Numpy` lies in its vectorisation capabilities.
- Formally, loops vanish on the Python level
- The looping takes place one level deeper based on optimising and compiling routines provided by `Numpy`
- The function `average_np()` makes use of these

]

import numpy as np
def average_np(n):

```{python, time_it=TRUE}
n=1000000
average_np(n)
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Vectorisation and Memory]
- The speedup in vectorisation is considerable, almost a factor of 10.
- However this comes at a price of significantly higher memory usage
- The reason is that `Numpy` attains speed by preallocating data that can be processed in the compiled layer.

To offer flexibility to their customers, cloud vendors offer different types of nodes that comprise various combinations of CPU (central processing unit), memory, storage, and networking capacity","A data center comprises a large number of computing nodes and necessary facilities to house the computer system","is the computer software that *glues* software applications with computing hardware. In cloud computing, middleware is used to enable communication and management data","Using computer resources to imitate other computer resources. By virtualisation, users are not locked with specific operating systems, CPU architecture, etc. Middleware and virtualisation are particularly important to ensure on-demand self-service of cloud computing","Cloud computing offers on-demand service. Cloud bursting refers to the process of dynamic deployment of software applications","is a computing service which has the ability to scale resources to meet requirements, e.g. Amazon's EC2 instances","is the human perception of the passage of time from the start to the completion of a task","The amount of time for which a CPU was used for processing instructions of a computer program or operating system, as opposed to, for example, waiting for input/output(I/O) operations or entering low-power (idle) mode.")) %>%
