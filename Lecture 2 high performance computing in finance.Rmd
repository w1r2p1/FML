# Introduction

- The recent financial crisis has highlighted demand for superior computing power in financial industries.
- In particular, failed stress testing highlighted the need for more reliable quantitative models and methods
- For industry practitioners, the availability of high-performance computing (HPC) resources allows the implementation of computationally challenging advance financial and insurance models for trading and risk management
- For academic researchers, HPC can allow the development of new models and methods to relax unrealistic assumptions without being limited to achieving analytical tractability to reduce computational burden.
- This lecture is a descriptive overview of the current and near-future state of HPC in finance

## Computationally expensive financial problems

1. Investment banks pricing derivatives post the financial crisis

2. Using market sentiment to improve second order stochastic dominance trading models

3. Designing an automated trading algorithm: .fancy[The Alpha Engine]

4. Optimisation the risk and profit of liquidating a number of shares before the end of a trading period

5. Building economic scenario generators for risk management systems

## Computationally expensive problems in investment banking
- Financial instruments (derivatives) traded on markets are essentially contractual agreement between two parties that involve the calculation and delivery of quantities of monetary currency or its economic equivalent.

- These instruments have increased in complexity which requires complicated mathematical logic for determining payment amounts: or *payoffs*.

- Traditional pricing methods have proved woefully inaccurate for these more complicated products.

- Expansion in computational power has seen methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, PDE differentiation, and Fourier methods improve the accuracy of pricing.
