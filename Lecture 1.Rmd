# Course objective

![](img/dixonMLiF.jpeg)

- Introduce the modern practices in finance of using algorithms to extract computer age statistical inference. 

- The purpose of this course is not to introduce students to the vast array of machine learning algorithms. 

- The purpose is to introduce the emerging field of [Financial Machine Learning (FML)](https://jfds.pm-research.com/) as a as a complementary enhancement to traditional financial research techniques. 

.bg-hot-pink.b--dark-pink.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
This course attempts machine learning as a non-linear extension of various topics in quantitative economics such as financial econometrics and dynamic programming, with an emphasis on novel algorithmic representations of data, regularization, and techniques for controlling the bias-variance tradeoff leading to improved out-of-sample forecasting.

# Computer age statistical inference

.heatinline[Context is king in statistics]

- Financial datasets used to solve modern investment problems offer unique challenges which are beyond many *plug and play* data science algorithms. 

--

- The era of "Big Data" has provided a backdrop for the rapid expansion of immense computer-based processing algorithms, for instance, random forest for prediction. 

--

- The importance of inferential arguments in support of the ML applications has emerged as an exciting (yet underdeveloped) field.  

--

- This is particularly true for financial research questions where the complexity of the **data story** (or more formally the data generating process which underpins the sample) result in notoriously noise covariance matrices.  

--

- A small percentage of information these matrices contain is *signal*, which is systemically suppressed by arbitrage forces. 

--

- This course will introduce best practice techniques in financial data science which can help illicit economically meaningful *signal* and answer contemporary financial research questions.

# Big Data - Big Compute in Finance
### Exponential growth in machine readable data to record and communicate activities in the financial system

- IBM has estimated that 90% of the world's data ssets have been created in the last 2 years.
- [IMB estimate by 2020 there will be 44 zettabytes (44 trillion gigabytes) created, 300 times the amount in 2005](https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/sites/default/files/infographic_file/4-Vs-of-big-data.jpg?cm_mc_uid=16172304396014932905991&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1494235431&cm_mc_sid_52640000=1494235431).

### Persistent growth in computer power

[<img src='img/2sigma.png' width="80px",align="center"\>](https://www.twosigma.com/) Hedge-fund firm Two Sigma has built a computing sysetem with more than 100 teraflops of power, which is 100 trillion calculations per second

# Why study FML?
- .large[Classical econometrics fails on these *Big* datasets]

- .large[Linear algebra methods (eg.OLS) can fail in high dimensional data where there can be more variables than observations.]

- .large[Geometric objects, like covariance matrices, fail to recognise the topological relationships that characterise networks]

- .large[FML offer numerical power and functional flexibility needed to identify complex patterns in high-dimensional space.]
---
class:inverse,middle
### Interaction effects all the way down
.large[
- High-dimensional datasets with many features (predictors) may have complex patterns.
- For $p$ features there may be up to $2^p-p-1$ interaction effects.
- Unlike ML algorithms, econometric models do not *learn* the structure of the data.
- In classical linear regression the model specification may easily miss some interactions, whereas, an ML algorithm, such as a decision tree, will recursively partition a dataset into subsets with simple patterns, which can be fit independently with simple linear specifications.

# Artificial intellience
 - We are now in the era of narrow AI.
 - AI experts' predictions vary as to when we can see *artificial general intelligence* (AGI)
--

## Machine Learning(ML)
 - This is generally thought of as a branch of AI
 - Traditional machine learning algorithms are designed for cross-sectional data sets.
 - Many financial problems require explicit modeling of complex time series properties.

--
 
### Deep learning
 - Is a branch of ML which has been the media darling of AI industry expansion
 - At its core it is using neural networks; algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain.
 - Statisticians are less impressed, and prefer to categorise these models as semi-parametric to non-parametric.

# Statistical Modeling Vs Machine Learning
- Supervised machine learning is often an algorithmic form of statistical model estimation in which the data generation process is treated as an unknown (Breiman 2001). 

- Model selection and inference is automated, with an emphasis on processing large amounts of data to develop robust models. 

- It can be viewed as a highly efficient data compression technique designed to provide predictors in complex settings where relations between input and output variables are non-linear and input space is often high-dimensional. 

- Machine learners balance filtering data with the goal of making accurate and robust decisions, often discrete and as a categorical function of input data. 

---
name: statistics1
class: middle, inverse

# Statistical Modeling Vs Machine Learning
- This fundamentally differs from maximum likelihood estimators used in standard statistical models, which assume that the data was generated by the model and typically have difficulty with over-fitting, especially when applied to high-dimensional datasets. 

- Given the complexity of modern datasets, whether they are limit order books or high-dimensional financial time series, it is increasingly questionable whether we can posit inference on the basis of a known data generation process.

- It is a reasonable assertion, even if an economic interpretation of the data generation process can be given, that the exact form cannot be known all the time. 

- The paradigm that machine learning provides for data analysis therefore is very different from the traditional statistical modeling and testing framework. 
- Traditional fit metrics, such as $R^2$, t-values, p-values, and the notion of statistical significance, are replaced by out-of-sample forecasting and understanding the bias–variance tradeoff. 

- Machine learning is data-driven and focuses on finding structure in large datasets. 

- The main tools for variable or predictor selection are regularization and dropout.

# Modeling paradigms
### Parametric models
- Parametric assume finite set of parameters and model the response as a function of the input variables and the parameters.
- They potentially easier to interpret but have limited flexibility, especially in big data with complex patterns.

- .bg-hot-pink.b--dark-pink.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[Examples: OLS regression, neural networks, hidden Markov models, etc]
### Non-parametric models
- They treat the parameter space as infinite dimensional; i.e. they introduce a hidden or latent function.
- They grow in complexity with more data.

-  .bg-hot-pink.b--dark-pink.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[Examples: kernel methods, support vector machines, Gaussian processes]

class: middle
# Modeling paradigms
- Models can also be distinguished into .bg-hot-pink[probabilistic] and .bg-hot-pink[deterministic].

- In finance, a particular niche of probabilistic models is occupied by *state-space models*.

- They assume the existences of a **latent (unobserved)** process, whose **evolution** drives a certain observable process.

- The evolution of the latent process and the dependence of the observable process on the latent process are usually given in stochastic, or probabilistic terms.

- Confusingly, deterministic models may produce probabilistic outputs, for example a logistic regression gives the probability that the response is positive given the input variables.

- The choice between probabilistic and deterministic falls under the general and more devisive topic of :

# Training set overfitting

## Problem

- Training set overfitting results from choosing a specification that is so flexible that it explains not only the signal, but also the noise.
- The results will be a model which is *overconfident* in predicting *incorrectly*

--
## Solutions

1. Evaluate the **generalisation error**, through resampling techniques and Monte carlo methods
2. **Regularisation methods** to prevent model complexity unless it is justified in terms of greater explanatory power. 
  - For example LASSO techniques to reduce parameters or early stopping to restrict the model's structure
3. **Ensemble techniques** to reduce the variance of the error by combining the forecasts of a collection of estimators.

---
class: middle

# Test set overfitting

.large[
- A standard approach in industry is to use historical data to **backtest** an investment strategy identified from the training set

- Researchers who run multiple statistical tests on the same data set are more likely to make a false discovery.

- This selection bias comes from fitting the model to perform well on the test set, not the train set.

- **Test set overfitting** occurs when a researcher backtests a strategy until the output achieves a desired performance.

- The poor performance of a backtest should be a sign to fix the research process, not the investment strategy.
]

---
class:middle

# Solutions to test set overfitting

1. Use the familywise error rate (FWER) or the Deflated Sharpe ratio. 
  
  - FWER evaluates the probability of at least one of the outcomes of a number of independent backtests is a false positive. The Deflated Sharpe ratio is a statistics that controls for the FWER.

2. Use combinatorial purged cross-validation methods (CPCV), which generate many test sets using resampling combinatorial splits of train and test sets.

3. Use historical series to estimate the underlying data-generating process, and use **Monte Carlo methods** to create *fake*/synthetic samples that match the statistical properties observed in history
