# What is cloud computing ?
- .heat[Cloud computing shares many of the similarities of electricity]

.center.large[In the early days of electrical power, corporations and factories where powered by on-site small-scale power plants. Today, large scale power plants with efficient transmission networks have powered modern industrial society, allowing electricity to be at everyone's disposal ar reasonable prices]

- .heat[Much like electricity the core concept of cloud computing is resource sharing]

# What is cloud computing ?

.fat[definitions:]

>A model for enabling ubiquitious, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or server provider interaction

`r tufte::quote_footer("National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) of the US Department of Commerce, 2019")`

>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (**"the cloud"**) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. Typically, you only pay for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

## Essential characteristics of cloud computing solutions
.heatinline[The follow distinguish cloud computing from other solutions, such as on-site high performance computing servers]

- .large.fancy[On-demand self-service] 
  - A consumer can provision computing capacity as needed without interaction with service provider.
- .large.fancy[Broad network access]
  - Computing resources are available to the consumer through the network and can  be accessed fro mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
- .large.fancy[Resource pooling]
  - Resources are dynamically assigned to customers' needs.
- .large.fancy[Rapid elasticity]
  - Capacities can be reconfigured automatically to scale rapidly in response to the changing demand.
- .large.fancy[Measured service]
  - The resource utilisation is automatically controlled and optimised by the cloud systems.  The usage is monitored, measured, and reported.

## Why high performance computing and why now?
.salt[Regulatory response to the flash crash of 2010]
> On the 6th May, 2010 at 2.45 p.m.(EST), the US stock market experienced a nearly 10% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only to recover most of ther loss a few minutes later

.saltinline[It took the regulatory agencies (SEC) five months to come up with an investigation report on this crash]

.heatinline[In the congressional hearings after the event, the SEC official give the primary reason for the long delay as the volumne of data to be investigated (~20 terabytes)]

.heatinline[HPC scientific computing systems such as the National Research Scientific Computing center(NERSC). routinely work with hundreds of terrabytes in minutes]

.heatinline[After the congressional hearing Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory (LNBL) established the Computational Intelligence and Forecasting Technologies (CIFT) project to promote HPC tools and techniques for analysing of financial times series data]

## QMS High-Performance Cloud Computing
- In this course we will be using a cloud-based Linux machine running [RStudio Server Pro](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/)
>Rstudio Server Pro us the preferred data analysis and integrated development experience for professional R users and data science teams who use R and Python. `r tufte::quote_footer("RStudio Team, 2020")`

- This machine is hosted on Microsoft Azure running a Linux (ubuntu 18.04) operating system with 64 vCPUs and 256 GiB of RAM.
- Student accounts will have approximately 1 vCPU and 4 GiB RAM.
- http://qms.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com:8787/
