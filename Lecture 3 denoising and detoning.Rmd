## Cloud computing with R and Python

- This course will expose you to the flexibility of cloud computing and combining R and Python.
- The School has a high performance compute virtual machine, set-up in Microsoft Azure.
- Financial institutions have a long history of heavily investing in technology for gaining market share and defending their current position.
- The democratisation of computing processing power by cloud providers, has lead to an explosion in financial machine learning applications.
- Today technology that would have costed millions 20 years ago can be rented for thousand from these cloud providers

>Meriwther spent $20 million on a state-of-the-art computer system and hired a crack team of financial engineers to run the show at LTCM.....

## Your Set Up in the Cloud

- Go to http://qms.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com:8787 on web browser.
- login using your student number as both the username and password
- Click on new session.
- You should now see something like this:

## Teaching mathematical concepts through code

- Understanding machine learning requires familiarity with many simple mathematical concepts
- **Some examples**
- The goal of this course is to build your intuition about these notions without getting overly technical
- In particular I will steer away from mathematical notation, which can be off-putting for those without any mathematics background and isn't strictly necessary to explain things well.
- Mostly, we will use coded practical example to illustrate the concepts
- This is a .large.fancy[**learning by doing**] approach when you can play around with the code yourself you understand underlying concepts.

# Why study denoising and detoning?


- .large[Covariance matrices are everywhere in finance.]
- .large[Empirical covariances measure the linear co-movement between a set of random variables]  
- .large[For example to estimate the linear comovement between FTSE 100 stocks you would gather 100 time series of each stocks returns]
- .large[They are used to:]

1. Run regressions
2. Estimate risk
3. Optimise portfolios
4. Simulate scenarios via Monte Carlo
5. Find clusters
6. Reduce the dimensionality of a set of potential predictors

# Why study denoising and detoning?

- .large[Empirical covariance matrices are estimated with flawed, incomplete data which leads to estimates with an amount of noise]

- .large[Such noise can render calculations using covariance matrix estimates useless]

 .large[ In finance, we need a procedure to reduce this noise and enhance the signal **before** using in subsequent analysis like those listed previously]
